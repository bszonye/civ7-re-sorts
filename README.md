## Resource Re-sorts 1.1.0
sorts the names and icons on the resource screen.

- sorts settlements by name, with the capital and cities first.
- groups resources by type, with city resources first, factory last.
- uses locale-appropriate sorting for names.
- does not modify **any** game scripts, for maximum compatibility.
