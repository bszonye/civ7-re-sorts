## Resource Re-sorts 1.2.0
sorts the names and icons on the resource screen.

- sorts settlements by name, with grouping options
- optionally list cities before towns
- optionally group by Factory, Rail Station, and Distant Lands bonuses
- optionally group by number of resource slots
- groups resources by type, with city resources first, factory last.
- uses locale-appropriate sorting for names.
- does not modify **any** game scripts, for maximum compatibility.

## localization
the mod is language-independent during play.
only the main menu screens (Mods and Options) contain localized text.

supported languages:

- German (translated by Chr1Z93)
- Korean (translated by Hotsolidinfill)
