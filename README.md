## Resource Re-sorts 1.3.0
better resource screen organization

sorts settlements by name, with multiple grouping options:
- separate cities and towns
- group factories and conditional bonuses
- group by number of resource slots

additional features:
- highlights important features (Rail Station, Port, Distant Lands)
- groups resources by type and class (city, bonus, treasure, factory)
- uses locale-appropriate sorting for names
- does not modify **any** game scripts, for maximum compatibility

## localization
the mod is language-independent during play.
only the menu screens (Mods and Options) contain localized text.

supported languages:

- French (translated by Somchai2548)
- German (translated by Chr1Z93)
- Italian (translated by leonardfactory)
- Korean (translated by Hotsolidinfill)
- Simplified Chinese (translated by v480615)
- Traditional Chinese (translated by v480615)
