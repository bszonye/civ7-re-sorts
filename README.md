## Resource Re-sorts 1.2.1
better resource screen organization

sorts settlements by name, with multiple grouping options:
- separate cities and towns
- group factories and conditional bonuses (Rail Station, Distant Lands)
- group by number of resource slots

additional features:
- groups resources by type and class (city, bonus, treasure, factory).
- uses locale-appropriate sorting for names.
- does not modify **any** game scripts, for maximum compatibility.

## localization
the mod is language-independent during play.
only the menu screens (Mods and Options) contain localized text.

supported languages:

- French (translated by Somchai2548)
- German (translated by Chr1Z93)
- Italian (translated by leonardfactory)
- Korean (translated by Hotsolidinfill)

thank you all for your help!
